       <p> Iâ€™ve come into software development from, what I consider, a very diverse educational/professional background which includes a Bachelors degree in Science, a Masters in Business Administration, professional work in specialty audio/video retail sales, and most recently clinical laboratory experience. </p>
       <p> As of right now I am located around Rochester, MN</p>

          <h3>A little bit about me:</h3>
          <p>
            I became interested in web development after working on a project for the lab I currently work in which needed coding elements for a data calculation and result anlysis/reporting. I found it so interesting that I decided to pursue it further.</p>
          <p> Funny enough, my main hobbies have nothing to do with my past professional and educational experiences. I find that I enjoy: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Drawing/making art.</li>
            <li>Traveling </li>
            <li>Video Games/TV/Movies! </li>
          </ul>
       <p> I am looking forward to working on new projects and learning new technical languages, so if you are looking for a developer who is excited to learn, then please reach out via the links below!</p>

     <!-- the articale contianer normally cointains blog posts, news casts, messages, etc. in this case the about me part serves like a blog post and therefore the articale cointainer was used. I also inttorduced both ordered and unorderlists in my description of hobbies and ranking of the places I will be traveling too.
